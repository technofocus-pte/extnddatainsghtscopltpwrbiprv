# Creating a narrative with Copilot for Power BI

## Task 1 – Creating a Narrative in Power BI service

In the Power BI service, you need to be in an appropriate workspace to
see the Narratives with Copilot visual button in the Visualizations
pane. The Copilot visual button is the same as the old narratives visual
button

1.  The **Narrative** visual needs content to summarize, so in the Power
    BI service, select the **OneLake data hub** from the left navigation
    pane.
